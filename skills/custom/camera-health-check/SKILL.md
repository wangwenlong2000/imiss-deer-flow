name: camera-health-check
description: Check video monitoring camera quality from sampled frames and return health status before downstream event generation. Use when Codex has camera_id and frames and needs to gate or downgrade event confidence for offline, unavailable, degraded, black-screen, blurred, occluded, frozen, corrupted, or shifted camera feeds.

# Camera Health Check

## Execution Priority

Prioritize calling this skill's `scripts/run.py` entrypoint first. Only write custom code after the script result is unsuitable or the script cannot cover the requested task.

## Input Resolution

If `frames` are missing but the user provided a video source, do not ask the user to provide frames and do not write custom camera diagnostics. First call `frame-sampling/scripts/run.py` to generate frames, then call this skill.

## Workflow

1. Read camera id and sampled frames.
2. Check frame availability and configured/manual health overrides.
3. Compute or accept quality signals for black screen, blur, occlusion, freeze, corruption, and view shift.
4. Return health status, health score, and issue reasons.

## Available Implementation

- Registry name: `camera-health-check`
- Python class: `src.skills.video_data.camera_health_check.CameraHealthCheckSkill`
- Pipeline caller: `src.orchestrator.pipeline.run_camera_pipeline`

## Standalone CLI

This Skill can be executed independently through the shared runner:

```bash
python camera-health-check/scripts/run.py \
  --input <input.json> \
  --config <config.json> \
  --output <result.json>
```

This directory owns registry skill `camera-health-check`, so the agent should call this script directly for this skill.

## Tool Invocation

```python
registry.get("camera-health-check").run({"camera_id": camera_id, "frames": frames}, context)
```

## Inputs

- `camera_id`
- `frames`
- Optional `health_status` override
- Optional `context.config["camera_health"][camera_id]` override

## Outputs

Returns `health_status`, `health_score`, and `issues`.

## Failure Modes

The current implementation returns success with `health_status="unavailable"` when no frames are available.

## Constraints

Do not create events or evidence. Low quality should reduce downstream confidence or trigger review.
